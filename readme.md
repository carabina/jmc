About

meTunes is based on the fundamental belief that a well-designed music library manager should play your albums in the correct order. And let you look at the album art while you play them!

Out of that simple idea comes meTunes. meTunes aims to replace iTunes for users with large personal libraries and no interest in subscription-based streaming services.

meTunes is basically an old version of iTunes, with some sensible ideas and features added. Among them:

  - Removes the massive headaches associated with using iTunes to migrate, transfer or otherwise modify your music library metadata and its underlying filesystem organization. Metadata is serialized in a sane way, and can be easily modified by the user. Tags are optionally written to files.
  - Offers meaningful curation of album artwork. Keep track of covers, inserts, miscellaneous PDFs, et cetera.
  - Users can define their own rich custom properties for media, which can be used for sorting, searching and playlist creation.
  - Shared libraries.
  - Better interface for playlist creation and song queue management.
  - Plays albums all the way through, in the correct order, with gapless and bit-perfect playback. We have the technology!
  - Un-bloated.
  - Open source!
