About
-----
![screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/UJJ1qC0.png)
meTunes is based on the fundamental belief that a well-designed music library manager should play your albums in the correct order. And let you look at the album art while you play them!

Out of that simple idea comes meTunes. meTunes aims to replace iTunes for users with large personal libraries and no interest in subscription-based streaming services.

Why meTunes?

  - Removes the massive headaches associated with migrating, transferring or otherwise modifying your music library and its underlying filesystem organization. Metadata is serialized in a sane way, and can be easily modified by the user.
  - Lets you meaningfully curate your album artwork.
  - Custom fields for sorting and searching.
  - Shared libraries. 
  - Plays albums all the way through, in the correct order. We have the technology!
  - Fast, and un-bloated.
  - Open source!
